# Deliver-It



Motivation:
---------

There are times when we are not able to go somewhere to buy something, or when food delivery is not possible.

What if someone present there could deliver that for you (maybe for some microcredit).

Motivated by this thought we built the app where you could deliver items to others and get your items delivered by them.

App Tour:
---------


Opening the app leads you to the login/signup/forgot tabs.

To signup, you need to provide the email address, link will be sent to the email address and after email verification, you can
login into the app.

### Home Page ###

Button for adding order takes you to Another Page (_Add Order Page_)

Next you see a list of orders (_Your Deliveries_). These are the orders you have accepted and you need to deliver.

Here you will see user whose order it is, the pickup location and delivery location.

Clicking any order shows all details:

Once delivered the order will be automatically removed from the list.
